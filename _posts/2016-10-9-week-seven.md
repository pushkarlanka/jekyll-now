### What did I do this past week?
A little bit of everything. I delivered a presentation for my Sociology class, had 2 interviews, and finished the week with 2 midterms and a coding challenge. Fortunately they all went well, and I'm looking forward to next week already. 

### What's in your way?
A few more interviews and a midterm, and I do have to get a head start on the OOP project to ensure an easier time the following week. It's always great to get things done early.

### What will you do next week?
This next week I plan to get a head start on the OOP project, even though there's a whole week before it's due. I found myself submitting at the last moment for the last project, and I don't want to repeat that this time. Aside from that, I have to study for a Sociology midterm and continue the interview prep. 

This week in OOP we had our first midterm, and I have to say that it went much better than I expected. The questions were very fair, and I liked how they were more coding/algorithm focused and not super detail oriented. 

### Tip of the week
I think we've all heard by now that writing code on a whiteboard is great practice for techincal interviews. I think it's also super valuable to get used to online text editors like CoderPad and Collabedit, for your phone screens. It's totally different from using your favorite IDE, and it'll be well worth your time to get used to it before the actual interview.
