### What did I do this past week?
Went to the career fair, had a few interviews, completed the Netflix project and somehow found time to sleep between the chaos. Quite easily, this was the most hectic week of the semester and I expect much of the same especially in the upcoming weeks. Recruitment season is a grind of its own but at this point I've learnt to just enjoy it. In other news, I got back into my cardio routine so that felt good. Running is a great stress buster for me, and hopefully I can keep it up through the semester.

### What's in your way?
Catching up with classes that I missed the last week. Unfortunately, I had to miss consecutive Alogrithms lectures with career fair and related events, so I'll have to allocate time to review the contents on my own. I really do enjoy the class so it shouldn't be too hard to find motivation. 

### What will you do next week?
I have a few second round interviews scheduled for the week, and it's possible that there will be a few more. Aside from that, I'd like to catch up with Algorithms coursework and maybe start preparing for the OOP midterm next week. Even though I don't have any hard deadlines for any of my classes this week, I definitely expect to keep myself busy.

This week in OOP we had a tech talk by an engineer from JPL. I've really enjoyed the two lectures by UT alumni that we've had in the class so far, and this one was especially interesting. It's awesome to see software that solves "real" problems, and we were pretty fortunate to see a live demo of the HoloLens integration with the Mars Rover. 

### Tip of the week
If you're still using Terminal on your Mac, stop. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) is a great replacement for Terminal (technically it's a terminal emulator), with better views, hotkeys and features. They seem to care more about delivering frequent updates than Terminal, and I haven't gone back since I started to use it a few years ago. Definitely check it out.
