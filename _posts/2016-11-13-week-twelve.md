### What did I do this past week?
This past week I flew to California for an interview, and then got started on the final OOP project. I had to get started on the project as soon as I came back, so there's been very little down time lately. I didn't have any midterms this week, so that was a nice change. 

### What's in your way?
I don't have any final exams this semester, so I'm stacked with final projects due in the next few weeks. This is when the semester usually gets most stressful, so I'll try to get started on all my projects earlier than I usually do.

### What will you do next week?
I need to finish the OOP project early in the week to give myself enough time to work on final projects in other classes. Also, I had to miss the last 2 lectures in OOP as I wasn't in town, so I'll definitely have to catch up on lecture content this week. If I manage to finish my projects earlier than expected, I'll try to get back in to my cardio routine.

### Tip of the week
If you're going to use AWS to power your web/mobile app's backend, make sure you register with AWS Educate using your UTexas email first! You'll get a ton of AWS credits and discounts on different service tiers. Even if you're not using AWS right now, it's probably a good idea to just register and see what's available.
