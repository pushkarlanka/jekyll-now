### What did I do this past week?
This past week I had a midterm and another interview. Unfortunately, I had to miss class on Monday as I wasn't feeling well. On the whole, it wasn't too stressful of a week.

### What's in your way?
The Darwin project. My partner and I have made really good progress, but I need to finish the project early in the week to give myself ample time to study for an Algorithms midterm on Thursday. 

### What will you do next week?
I'll be wrapping up the Darwin project early in the week and start studying for Algorithms soon after. I'm pretty happy that we're mostly covering dynamic programming in Algorithms right now, as this overlaps really well with interview prep. Outside of classes, it's my birthday on Thursday so I'll try to go out and have some fun after the last few weeks of non-stop work.

### Tip of the week
If anyone's just looking for a comprehensive list of potential companies to apply to, I've found [this](http://www.intern.supply) pretty useful.
