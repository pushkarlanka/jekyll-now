title: Final Week
---

### What did I do this past week?
Finished my last midterms, submitted 2 projects and breathed a huge sigh of relief as the week/semester came to an end.

### What's in your way?
Nothing. I've been waiting for a while to finally say that!

### What will you do next week?
I'll submit a final paper on Monday, and board a flight to India the next day. That's right, I don't have any final exams this semester! I haven't been back to the homeland in over a year, so I'm super excited.

With this being the final week, here's a review of my thoughts on the class.

###Lectures
Certainly my favorite aspect of the class. The Downing experience is something I've heard about since I was a wee freshman in UTCS, and the first lecture of this class showed me why it was so popular among students here. Professor Downing is absolutely filled with energy in his lectures and shows great passion for the subject he teaches. I've been constantly surprised with both how knowledgable he is about the subject, and more importantly, how excited he is to share that knowledge with us. OOP lectures have certainly been the most engaging ones I've had during my time here. The cold calling also does a good job of keeping you attentive.

###Projects
I had mixed feelings about the projects in the class. The final 3 projects - Allocator, Darwin and Life - I thought were great in their requirements, in that they really built off content we learnt during lectures. I finished each project with a solid understanding of new C++ and OOP concepts, and the work load was just about right. The first 2 projects were considerably easier, which I thought was especially understandable with the first one, given that we were still getting used to the developer tools used in the class. The second project (Netflix) seemed out of place to me, as it was neither demanding nor did it seem to impart any important learning outcomes. That was really the only project that I was disappointed with, but the final 3 projects made up for that.

The standard requirements for each project I thought were overkill at times, but they certainly forced me to get acquainted with an entire suite of tools that I'll very likely be using in the industry. Overall, I thought the projects did a great job of reinforcing class concepts and forcing us to pay attention to detail.

###Exams
My personal experience with the exams was a positive one, as it was pleasant change to finally have to write code on an exam. I thought the content was fair, and we certainly weren't thrown any curveballs. My only disappointment was the lack of practice exams, as I think that would've made the exam format a lot clearer, and made our efforts to study more concentrated.

###Final Thoughts
I can certainly say that I'm a more 'industry ready' programmer after this semester, and I think that's a valuable experience amidst all the fundamental CS classes that we all take here at UT.

All in all, thanks for a great class Professor Downing!

### Tip of the week
I'm going to reiterate one of my previous tips, but I think this could be seriously useful with Finals week approaching. If you need to stay free of distractions while studying, check out [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com).
