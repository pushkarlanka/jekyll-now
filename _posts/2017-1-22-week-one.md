### What did I do this past week?
Class registration was a challenge as always, so I spent the week bouncing around different classes and the advisor's office before finally settling on a schedule on Friday. I didn't much work to do, so it was great to just get back in the groove of classes and catch up with friends after the long winter break.

### What's in your way?
Not much in my way. I have a few assignments coming up this week, and Collatz due the week after. I took Downing's OOP class in a previous semester, so I don't expect the project to cause too many problems.

### What will you do next week?
I'll get started on assignments in other classes, and try to get a head start on Collatz. As I said earlier, I don't expect there to be many blockers but it's always nice to get things done before the weekend. Other than that, I hope to continue working on a side project that I started over the winter break. I'll have more details in a future post.

### Tip of the week
If you're interested in developing a bot for Messenger or some other platform out there, I recommend you check out Facebook's [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai). It has a slick interface and more importantly, the NLP accuracy is pretty awesome. I got to use the framework in limited capacity over my last internship, and I'm hoping to use it again at some point.
