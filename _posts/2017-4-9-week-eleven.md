### What did I do this past week?
Finished up phase 2 of the IDB project, and that took a considerable amount of the week. We were hoping to finish by Wednesday, but some unexpected deploy issues meant that we worked pretty close to the last few hours to get things resolved. Fortunately, my other classes weren't too demanding so I was able to dedicated most of my time to this project.

### What's in your way?
Phase 3 isn't due for another two weeks, so my main obstacles for the week are in other classes.

### What will you do next week?
I have an AI project due on Wednesday, and it's probably the most challenging one yet. Even though the Phase 3 isn't due any time soon, it would be nice to meet up with my group and lay out our responsibilities. Outside of classes, hopefully I can continue my running routine.

### What's my experience of the class?
More SQL. As I alluded to in previous posts, the class has seemingly taken a sharp turn away from Python and into Database theory and that definitely caught me off guard. That being said, it's been interesting to get exposure to SQL as it's something I haven't dabbled with before. The quizzes haven't been great of late, and I need to get back into the habit of reviewing lecture notes the night before class.

### Tip of the week
I tried using Instacart for the first time this past week and I have to say it's pretty awesome. As someone who doesn't have a car here, it can be a serious challenge to get groceries in bulk. Delivery time was super quick, and I even had my delivery charge waived as a first time user. Highly recommend!
