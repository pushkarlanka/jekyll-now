### What did I do this past week?
Our group finished phase 3 of the project pretty quickly, as there wasn't much to do beyond adding search capability and the visualization of the other group's API. I also had the usual homework in my other classes, but nothing too stressful.

### What's in your way?
I have the final SWE presentation, SWE midterm and projects in other classes due in the next 2 weeks, so it looks like things will be getting busy soon. I want to get a head start on the SWE midterm as I'm a little unclear on some of the concepts that were covered recently.

### What will you do next week?
I'll start my preparation for the SWE midterm, and get together with my group to plan out the presentation. We're scheduled to do the presentation next week, but it would be nice to have everything planned out by the end of the weekend. Outside of classes, my running routing is going well and I hope to continue that.

### What's my experience of the class?
The focus of the class has shifted somewhat to design patterns, which I did not really expect in this course. That being said however, it's definitely nice to get exposed to best practices as we're doing right now. The quizzes have been much better recently, and I hope to finish the semester on a high with only a few quizzes remaining.

### Tip of the week
I don't have anything tech related this week, so I'll just sign off by reminding everyone to avoid all-nighters with finals approaching. It's a trap I've fallen into in the past, and it's not worth it. You're much better off preparing in advance and getting a good night's rest, especially the night before a test. Hopefully I listen to my own advice in the coming weeks.
