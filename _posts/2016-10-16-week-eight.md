### What did I do this past week?
I caught up with classes and school work, and did a few interviews. Interviewing has gotten progressively better throughout the semester, and I'm at the point where I feel comfortable in any kind of interview setting (phone, skype, whiteboard). Hopefully I can keep this up for the final round interviews I have coming up, and if all goes well, I can finally divert my attention away from interview prep. 

### What's in your way?
More interviews, a midterm on Monday and the Allocator lab. My partner and I have made really good progress on the lab, so I don't think it should be much of an obstacle in the coming week.

### What will you do next week?
I'll be meeting up with my partner to finish the project early in the week, as I really don't want to submit at the last moment again. The project has been pretty straightforward, and all that remains for us is writing unit tests. Aside from OOP, I'll have to continue the interview prep and perhaps start a side project.

This week in OOP we learnt more about the heap and memory management in C++. The class really does reinforce how much control the language gives you as a developer, and while that might be cumbersome and frustrating for small projects, it does pay dividends for large scale systems.

### Tip of the week
If you're trying to get more efficient with Vim, I highly recommend checking out [OpenVim](http://www.openvim.com) tutorials. It's worked really well for me.
