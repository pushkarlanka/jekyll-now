### What did I do this past week?
This past week I finished the Netflix project and got started on my first Programming Languages project. Outside of classes, I managed to consistently maintain my cardio routine and get some good sleep. All in all, it was a great week. 

### What's in your way?
I have submissions in almost all my classes due every Monday, so that's always going to be in my way every weekend for the rest of the semester. Needless to say, the key is to start early and I've done a pretty good job at that so far this semester. I have another AI project due on Wednesday which I still haven't started, so I'll need to get on that immediately.

### What will you do next week?
I'll try to finish up the 2 projects in AI and PL early in the week so as to "relax" towards the end of the week. If time permits, I'd like to get started on preparing for the SWE midterm scheduled for the following week. I feel pretty confident about the content so far, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to do a quick revision before next weekend. Hopefully I can make it to the ACM programming competition this Friday, as I really enjoyed going to the last one.

### What's my experience of the class?
I found the Netflix project much easier to do in Python compared to the C++ counterpart in Downing's OOP class. That being said however, I'm not a big fan of the assignment as it's unclear to me as to what the learning outcomes of this project were intended to be. In my opinion, the restriction on using libraries inhibits us from learning best practices in Python, which I think is more valuable than having us implement trivial logic/algorithms ourselves. This project would've made more sense if the intent was to force us to use map, reduce and labmdas.
Other than the project, I'm continuing to enjoy the lectures and the Python learning experience.

### Tip of the week
I'm glad to say that recruiting season for the upcoming summer is in the past for me, but for those of you who are still out there searching for a summer internship or full time position, check out [intern.supply](http://www.intern.supply). It definitely makes it a lot easier to send out multiple applications if you have a centralized list of companies, with the additional capability to apply search filters. Happy job hunting!
