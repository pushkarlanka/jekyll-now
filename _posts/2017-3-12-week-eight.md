### What did I do this past week?
This past week I took a midterm in Artificial Intelligence, and ended up doing pretty well. Preparation for the exam took up most of my week, and I was lucky to not have any major work in SWE or Programming Languages. All in all, it wasn't super hectic, and I'm just looking forward to Spring Break now.

### What's in your way?
Nothing, it's Spring Break!

### What will you do next week?
I'm staying in Austin for Spring Break to experience SXSW for the first time. I've heard great things about it from friends, and I'm hoping to hit up all the events that I can for the first half of the week, before possibly heading to Houston during the second half of the week. I'll also be keeping in touch with my group partners to hopefully finish the first phase of the SWE final project as soon as possible. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Not much has changed, as the lectures continue to be a deep dive into Python. I'm looking forward to this last part of the class, as I'd love to build a web app that I can look back at proudly. I've used Flask before, but this will be my first time using React.

### Tip of the week
I first dabbled with Flask about a year ago, and I found [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ)'s tutorials to be super useful at the time. There might be better resources out there now, but I'd highly recommend going through his series before you get started.
