### What did I do this past week?
This past week I got back into the routine of classes and due dates, as I had a midterm and 2 projects due. The Software Engineering project wasn't too challenging conceptually, but there was a long list of requirements to complete so it definitely occupied a large portion of the week. I also attended the ACM Programming Competition towards the end of the week, and actually won a prize for finishing near the top of the leaderboard, so that was fun.

### What's in your way?
My group and I will have to start phase 2 of the project as soon as possible. The last phase taught us that unexpected errors are to be expected, and it's not quite as easy to troubleshoot some bugs when everyone in the class is working on their own thing. Piazza becomes a little less helpful, but it's definitely a fun challenge to come up with a design for your project and take responsibility for the bugs and pitfalls that come with it.

### What will you do next week?
I'll have to complete some homework due at the beginning of the week, and then shift my focus to Phase 2 of the project. Outside of school, the Longhorn Run is coming up really soon and I've been keeping up my running routine for more than a month now. I'll need to continue that in the coming week. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Last week's lecture content was less of a Python review and more of an introduction to database theory, which I really enjoyed. I like how Downing seems to be shifting the focus to concepts that we could find useful on this project, and extending those concepts to more advanced variations. As for the project, I thought the instructions and distinction for phase 1 were pretty vague at times, and made the project harder than it should've been. All in all, it wasn't too tricky, but the week of break in between made it a challenge to get together with our group and collaborate. Luckily, that shouldn't be a problem anymore.

### Tip of the week
Sign up for the [Longhorn Run](http://www.utlonghornrun.com)! Even if you're not super intent on running the entirety of the 10K or 5K, it's still really fun to just get together with some friends and pace yourselves through it. If that isn't convincing enough, you'll get a cool shirt!
