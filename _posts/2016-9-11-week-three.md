### What did I do this past week?
It's finally safe to say that I'm back in the groove of classes and recruitment season. The final parts of the collatz project took longer than expected, as there was just a whole lot of detail on Piazza that required careful and close attention to grasp. All in all, it was pretty satisfying to close that last (19th?) issue and press the submit button. Aside from OOP, I managed to continue to work on a side project (check out my url-shortener on GitHub if you're interested), and continued interview prep. This should remain fairly typical for the next few weeks. 

### What's in your way?
I've got a couple of company events to attend this week, and my resume hasn't been updated in a few months. Oops. Aside from that, it should be a pretty usual week, with the advantage of not having to submit an OOP project. Getting started might not be easy though, so I'll consider that a blocker.

### What will you do next week?
This next week I plan on continuing the effective and healthy routine that I've gotten used to these past few weeks. I'll have to start on the Netflix project, and I do have to say that it looks pretty exciting. Hopefully I can find a partner to pair up with soon enough, so we can get right down to it. Aside from that, I've got quite a few assignments due over the week so I expect to spend a lot of time in the library. 

This week in OOP, I finally got cold called in class! Thankfully, I was caught at a good time and managed to answer the question pretty accurately. It's nice to get that off my back, and the next time I get called I surely won't feel like a deer in headlights. 

### Tip of the week
This probably isn't groundbreaking for most readers, but those of you who are new to Git could find great use with Atlassian's [SourceTree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree). While I love using the command line for adding, committing and pushing my code, I find SourceTree's GUI super useful for diffs. And if the command line isn't your cup of tea, you might find SourceTree even more useful than I do!
