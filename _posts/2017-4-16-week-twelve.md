### What did I do this past week?
Finished up the AI project, which took a considerable amount of the week. I had to rewatch certain lectures to get a good grip on the concepts required to complete the project, but I'm glad I'm fully up to speed now.

### What's in your way?
Phase 3 of the project. Our group has been pretty slow to start this project, so we'll realy have to ramp up quickly. I think there's going to be an increased need for communication in this project as we'll have to correspond with 2 other groups about the API implementations. I don't have much in my way in other classes.

### What will you do next week?
We'll need to get started on phase 3 immediately. I'm pretty confident we can finish it quickly as the major portions of the website seem to be completed already. Outside of SWE, I just have the general weekly assignments in all my classes. And as I've been preaching in previous blog posts, I hope to maintain my running routine.

### What's my experience of the class?
We've turned our attention over to Refactoring, and it hasn't been too challenging so far. I'm not sure if I find it very interesting however, and I won't make a firm judgment on that until we learn more.

The quizzes have been going better as I've gotten back into the habit of reviewing lecture notes before class. As challenging as the quiz questions can seem to be at times, they really don't go beyond the scope of what we learn in lecture so it's totally possible to stay prepared for them.

### Tip of the week
Use [Flask-Cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make sure that your API is available cross-origin. The group using our API wasn't able make requests from their website until we made this fix.
