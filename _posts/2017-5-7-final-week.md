title: Final week
---

It's finally coming to an end. I've taken Downing's classes for the past year (OOP in the Fall and SWE in the Spring) and I have to say it's been a unique and rewarding experience throughout. I remember finishing the first week of OOP thinking that cold calling of names was the most intimidating thing ever and that I really had to bring my A game to not embarass myself in front of the entire class. 10 months later, I can confidently that I've definitely embarassed myself a few times, but that doesn't bother me anymore. Downing was always super helpful when a student stubmled, and he really just wants you to succeed. If anything, both of Downing's classes have taught me to appreciate finer details in code and write higher quality solutions. If it can be done in one line, DO IT!

Specifically about Software Engineering, the first half of the class serves as a ramp up to Python. For someone with a background in the language like myself, it can seem a little mundane at times, but Downing's emphasis on using absolute best practices is definitely eye-opening. I've never used a generator or decorator before this class, but it's things like that make you truly proficient in a language. If you're not using your tools to the best of your advantage, what good is that? Downing really does a great job of emphasizing coding practices, and I think that's super valuable when building real world systems.

As for things that caught me off guard, I didn't expect the class to cover SQL and design patterns in the second half as it did, but it's understandable when you consider that covering a language like Python for a full semester is kind of overkill. I do appreciate what I've walked away with given my very limited understanding of SQL lingo before this class. 

I would definitely recommend this class to students in the future, especially if you're a freshman or sophomore. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to do so given the high demand of this class but I do believe the department should restrict a certain number of seats to freshmen and sophomores. Personally, I would have loved to have taken this class before my internships, as I think there's a lot of overlap in skills that this class teaches and that companies demand of interns.

It's nice to finally wrap up this semester and look ahead to the summmer. I'm going to be interning at Facebook in Menlo Park, and I'm super excited to meet new people and become a better developer. This class and perhaps even more so CS 371p (also with Downing) have prepared us well to write high quality code, and it'll be a fun challenge to put my skills to the test in the real world.

Adios!
