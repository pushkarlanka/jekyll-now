### What did I do this past week?
I spent the initial part of the week finishing up assignments in other classes, before shifting my focus over to studying for the SWE midterm. I found that it didn't take too long to study for the midterm, and I think that's a testament to the fact that Professor Downing really ensures that we understand the material during lecture. Most of my preparation just consisted of trying out corner cases that we might not have covered in lecture.

### What's in your way?
I have an AI midterm coming up this week, which I'm a little worried about. I'm loving the class so far, but the theory portion of the class can get challenging at times. Luckily, it's towards the end of the week, so I have time.

### What will you do next week?
The usual. I'll have to complete the weekly assignments in all my classes with the additional burden of having a midterm. Hopefully I can finish the first half of the semester on a high, before kicking it back over Spring Break!

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm glad that I didn't have to struggle to study for the midterm, due to organized structure of the lectures and notes that Professor Downing posts after each class. Having said that however, I wasn't really a fan of the exam format as it seemed counter-intuitive to make it completely multiple choice. In my opinion, multiple choice exams don't fit well for CS classes, simply because of the subjective nature of writing good code. I think it would've been a better test of our knowledge if we were asked to implement a certain feature rather than put it in a multiple choice format.

### Tip of the week
Make the most of Spring Break! Whether that's just relaxing with friends/family, going to the beach or working on that side project, enjoy the time away from classes. Needless to say, things can get quite busy after the break so take this time to refresh yourselves.
