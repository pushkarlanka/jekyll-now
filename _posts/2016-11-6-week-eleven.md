### What did I do this past week?
This past week I finished up the Darwin project, and took an Algorithms midterm. The unit testing part of Darwin took longer than we expected, so the final parts of the lab were quite a drag. I did think that the actual problem was quite interesting though. My midterm also went really well, and hopefully I can finish the semester on a high.

### What's in your way?
I need to get started on projects in 3 different classes, OOP included. I don't have any finals this semester, but that only means that I'm stacked with midterms and final projects due in the last week of classes. I don't have any immediate deadlines this week though.

### What will you do next week?
This next week I plan to get started on the final OOP project. I'm flying out for an interview in the middle of the week, so I probably won't get started until the end of the week. If this project is anything like previous ones in terms of difficulty, I'm confident I can finish it in under a week. 

### Tip of the week
I don't have any techincal tips this week, so I'm just going to remind you to GO OUT AND VOTE! I think it's great that so many students on campus have already early voted, but you do get a last chance to vote this week. Don't waste it.
