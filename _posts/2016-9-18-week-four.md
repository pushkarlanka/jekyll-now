### What did I do this past week?
This week I devoted most of my time to a personal project and preparation for next week's career fair. I didn't have a whole lot of school work due so it was the perfect opportunity to work on those extracurriculars.

### What's in your way?
Getting my life together. Just kidding, I just need to make sure to make good conversations at career fair, and hopefully line up a few interviews before the end of the week. I've also got the Netflix project in OOP due on Thursday, so hopefully I can successfully get through the week without losing my mind.

### What will you do next week?
This next week I plan to hit up most of the recruiting events on campus, or at least as many I can manage to. I've also made decent progress on the OOP project, and I'm going to cram these next few days to get it done before potential interviews.

This week in OOP we learnt more about pointers, references and values in C++, and it's actually been really interesting. The whole time I couldn't help but question why I didn't this class before 439. Would've made those random C errors make a lot more sense!

### Tip of the week
My tip of the week is to check out the [Brogrammer Theme](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme) on Sublime! It's not going to make you more productive or anything, but I think it looks and feels a lot better than the default. If you're like me and are using Sublime to write your OOP projects, definitely give it a look.
