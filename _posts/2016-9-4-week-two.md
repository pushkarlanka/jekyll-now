### What did I do this past week?
Needless to say, this past week was more hectic than the first. Gone was the honeymoon period of syllabus week and cheeful introductions, as we were finally assigned projects and quizzes in class. I had a few headaches with figuring out last minute late-adds into classes, but I guess I can finally say that registration for the semester is behind me.It was a busier week than most around this time of the semester, as I had to actually find time to get a wisdom tooth pulled out in the middle of the week. That wasn't very fun. As the pain meds finally wear off and I set back into reality, I've managed to get a start on the assignment and completed a good amount this weekend. 

### What's in your way?
No real blockers for now, but I just late-added a class on Friday, and needless to say I'm a little lost in the class.Aside from that, I've got to finish the final parts of the OOP project. I certainly thought that the Docker setup would be tricky, but thankfully that was a smooth process. 

### What will you do next week?
This probably won't change for the next few weeks/months, but I've got to continue to grind and find a way to balance preparing for the reruitment season, while staying on top of classes. Classes will take priority this week, at least as long as I've got the OOP project pending. Now that I know my exact schedule for the semester, I look forward to attending each class without that feeling of doubt that I may drop it. Outside of academics, my running routine has gotten more consistent and I'm going to try to go past the 5K mark without taking any breaks this week!

The second week in the class has been enjoyable. I really appreciate how Downing takes a keen interest in making sure that each one of us knows exactly how to begin and work smartly on the project. Having a professor essentially take an entire class to give us a step by step agenda for the project was a refreshing change, and I certainly think it saves a lot of our time outside the classroom. Having said that, I certainly don't expect this approach for every project down the line when we'll have a better idea of the expectations of a project, and that's totally fine. The cold calling of names in class isn't as intimidating as it was at the beginning, and I've really come to realize that it's kept me super attentive at all times. The content of the lectures is pretty detail oriented, and unwavering attention really is required to keep up.

### Tip of the week
If you're prone to getting distracted while working, consider using [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com). SelfControl essentially asks you for a list of URLs, and will subsequently block any requests to those URLs for a duration set at your discretion. This really enforces the practice of not getting distracted while doing serious work, and in case of an emergency you still have your phone to fall back on. I've been increasing the block duration to up to 6 hours a day this week and I've noticed great results. You'd be suprised as to how much free time you can make by blocking out those Facebook breaks.
