### What did I do this past week?
This past week was probably my most stress free week of the semester, with no midterms and just the typical weekly assignments. It's always nice to get a breather like that this late in the semester, and it's unlikely to happen again soon. I managed to fix my sleep cycle and eat healthy the whole week! Also, I attended Facebook's HTF talk on Thursday and got to try out a demo of the Oculus Rift. I think I'm convinced that VR is incredible. 

### What's in your way?
My group has been pretty slow to start phase 2 of the project, but we do have our DB set up and hosted already. The major challenge remaining is getting pagination, sorting and filtering done. We're still at a crossroads as to whether we want to do this server side or client side, and I hope we can come to a decision and get it implemented soon.

### What will you do next week?
Get going on Phase 2 of the project immediately, and hopefully finish the brunt of the work by Wednesday. Projects in this class always require that you be extremely diligent when submitting, so I like to leave a full day to make sure that happens stress-free. That might just be wishful thinking though.

### What's my experience of the class?
Lectures this week have mostly been an extension of last week, in that we've continued covering Database theory with some more practical examples. I definitely did not expect this much of a focus on SQL in this course, but it's been interesting to learn. The quizzes have been harder for me of late, and I just need to make sure that I review the previous lecture's notes before going to into each lecture. Easier said than done I suppose.

### Tip of the week
I found it extremely useful to a have PostgreSQL GUI when updating data in our hosted database, and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) seems to be the best free available tool out there. I found v1.3 to be quite buggy, but had no troubles after installing v1.2 instead.
