### What did I do this past week?
I finished the Collatz project, which was harder than I expected, and completed initial assignments in all my other classes. All my classes are pretty project intensive, so it's gotten a little hectic already. So far, I've managed to attend all my classes while maintaining a sane sleep cycle, and I'm really hoping that I can continue this trend as the semester progresses. 

### What's in your way?
I'm taking 10 CS credits this semester, and the work seems to be piling up pretty quickly. I've managed to stay on top of things so far, and fortunately I've found all my classes to be really interesting, so hopefully I don't burn out. This coming week seems to be harder than last week, for starters.

### What will you do next week?
I'll have to get started on projects in all my classes, and might actually put off Netflix until the weekend. I did a similar assignment in OOP last semester, so I'm hoping that I can finish the project without facing too many surprises. If I can make good enough progress on my AI and Programming Languages projects, I'll try to start Netflix before the weekend. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Collatz was more challening than I expected, partially because I underestimated Python's speed inferiority compared to C++. Needless to say, it required a lot more optimization than the C++ version did. To make this more complicated, we were kind of thrown a curveball with the project specs changing the day before submission. Fortunately, Professor Downing allowed us to submit a complete meta cache solution for a certain range of input, and accepted a naive solution for the rest. As a result, I didn't have to change much of my code, but it was frustrating to have to go back and change things so close to the deadline. After having taken OOP last semester, I'm confident that this was a one off case and I'm looking forward to better project experiences over the rest of the semester

On the bright side, I did really well on the quizzes this week. Let's hope that continues.

### Tip of the week
It can sometimes be annoying to run git diffs on terminal, especially if your terminal's code highlighting isn't up to the mark. Using a git client like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) can make your git workflow a lot easier, particularly if you're not used to a lot of git commands. Personally, I don't use SourceTree to make any git commands, but I do love their diffs. Give it a shot, and you'll probably find some features worth using during your next project!
