### What did I do this past week?
I finished some final projects and starting preparing for final exams that I have in the next 2 weeks. Our presentation in SWE isn't until Wednesday, but we've managed to make most of our slides already. Unfortunately, I didn't get much time to prepare for the SWE midterm this past week.

### What's in your way?
Finals preparation. It's easy to look ahead to the summer and slack off at this point of the year, but that's the worst trap that one can fall into. Final project/exam grades account for so much of the overall grade that I need to make sure I'm on point with my studying habits for the next 2 weeks. That includes consistently eating 3 meals a day and getting a good night's rest.

### What will you do next week?
I'll try to finish preparing for the presentation early in the week, so I can study for finals in SWE and my other classes that have all unfortunately cluttered toward the end of the week. I'm feeling pretty confident about most of the material in all my classes, but I'm still expecting long hours of studying this entire week.

### What's my experience of the class?
We wrapped up with design patterns and started the final presentations this past week. Fortunately, there aren't any quizzes left in the semester and I'm glad that the quizzes in the last few weeks went much better than those in weeks prior. I thought overall the second half of this course was a little scattered and less structured than the first half, or even compared to Downing's OOP class. I'm not sure how that will affect my exam preparation, but it's definitely different from what I've seen before.

### Tip of the week
Finish strong! Just going to reiterate some of productivity tips from earlier in the semester. Download [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com) to block all those websites that are begging to grab your attention. Finish tasks incrementally, with the smaller/easier ones to begin with and the harder ones to follow. And finally, get some sleep! I've sworn to myself that I wouldn't pull any all nighters this semester unlike past semesters, and it's working wonders.
