### What did I do this past week?
I finished projects in my Artificial Intelligence and Programming Languages classes, and also took a quiz in the latter. As I alluded to in an earlier post, the CS workload has been pretty heavy this semester, and this past week wasn't really an exception. Fortunately, SWE was pretty light this week as there weren't any deadlines. 

### What's in your way?
Nothing really in my way except the Netflix project. The rest is just standard weekly assignmnents. I do need to make sure to keep up with the readings in Programming Languages however, as I don't want to fall behind too much.

### What will you do next week?
I need to get started on the Netflix project, as I'd like to finish it a day or two before the due date. I did a similar project in OOP previously so I'm too worried, but if Collatz taught me anything it's that changing languages can make for quite a few complications. Other than that, it's just the usual weekly assignments in my other classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience in the class is still positive, but as I said earlier I'm mostly looking forward to the final project. I know Python fairly well already, so some lectures have been a little dry. That being said, Downing's lectures never fail to teach you something you didn't know, and it's pretty interesting to learn intricacies of the language that I wasn't aware of before.

### Tip of the week
Check out Sublime's [Brogrammer Theme](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme)! It offers a different color scheme and flatter design than the default theme, and I've been using it for a while without going back. Might seem kind of trivial, but you might as well find a theme that you love if you code for long hours.
