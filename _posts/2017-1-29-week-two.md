### What did I do this past week?
Finished some last minute registration for classes, and got started on assingments in all my classes. It's always hard to get back into the groove of things at the start of semester, but I think I've gotten over the hump fairly quickly this time. I'm glad I got enrolled into all the classes I needed, as registration seemed like a nightmare at one point.

### What's in your way?
I need to finish Collatz, and my first homework in Programming Languages. Thankfully, my other classes don't have anything due this week so it should be smooth sailing.

### What will you do next week?
I'll get started on the aforementioned assignments, and continue my running routine. I signed for a marathon this upcoming summer, so I'm trying to get in shape starting now. It's in San Francisco, and [here](http://www.thesfmarathon.com) is the link if you're interested! 

### Tip of the week
If you have trouble with getting distracted while working, check out [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com). You can set a blacklist of websites to block over a duration of your choice, and that's all you need to do! I typically set block durations around 2 to 3 hours, but I like to challenge myself sometimes and try to block for 6 hours or above. I've found this to be a super useful strategy to achieve maximum productivity!
