### What did I do this past week?
I had a few more interviews, finished the Allocator lab and took a midterm for my Sociology class. The Allocator lab wasn't too bad, and my partner and I actually finished it ahead of schedule. The interviews went well, and hopefully I can wrap things up before the end of semester.

### What's in your way?
I've had a cough and cold for few days now, which is a real bummer especially when you have interviews coming up. Other than that, I need to figure out my class schedule for the Spring before this Friday. 

### What will you do next week?
I have a midterm on Tuesday that I don't feel prepared for at the moment, but I'm confident that I can ramp up quickly. I have interviews at the end of the week, so I'll try to spend the first half of the week getting a head start on the Darwin project. I've heard that this project is more time consuming than the previous ones, so I definitely don't want to leave things hanging until next week. 

### Tip of the week
If you're looking for a good setting to do video/phone interviews, the Union and PCL allow you to book study rooms for up to 3 hours in a week. I booked a room for an interview this past week and it was certainly a lot better than sitting in my dimly lit room. Lighting is especially important in video interviews, so if your place is poorly lit, definitely check these rooms out.
