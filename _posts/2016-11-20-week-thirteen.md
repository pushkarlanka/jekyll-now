### What did I do this past week?
This past week I finished the final OOP project for the semester, and wrapped up some projects in other classes as well. I received some great news on a final round interview from last week, so I've been feeling pretty great all week. The semester is almost over, and things are looking good at the moment.

### What's in your way?
Not much. I'll start studying for midterms in the last week of classes over Thanksgiving break, but I'm not too worried. My main hurdle right now is walking around with a sprained ankle, which I sustained while playing Basketball this weekend.

### What will you do next week?
I'll be in Austin for a few days before going home, and I finally have some down time. I was considering renting a bike and exploring the city this week, but that was before I came down with an ankle sprain. If I end up having to stay at home, I'll try to get a head start on the extra credit assignment.
